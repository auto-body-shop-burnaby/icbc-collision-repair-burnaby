<h1>ICBC Collision Repair Process in Burnaby, BC</h1>

<p>
An ICBC collision repair involves more than visible body work.
The outcome is largely determined by three factors:
<strong>damage documentation</strong>,
<strong>repair planning</strong>,
and <strong>communication</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Shops also have to sequence work carefully. Structural repairs,
refinishing, and reassembly must happen in the correct order to ensure
the vehicle is restored safely. Rushing this process can compromise
repair quality, which is why reputable ICBC repair shops prioritize
accuracy over speed.
